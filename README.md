# YouTube-Downloader
A small side project that uses [Pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube3/) as a basic video downloader for YouTube videos. At the moment the highest video quality that can be downloaded is 720p. 

No GUI yet, as it's just a small side project and just done through the command line. 

In future updates I will add the ability to download in higher quality (1080p at the least) and change from CLI to a proper GUI that runs through an exe.
